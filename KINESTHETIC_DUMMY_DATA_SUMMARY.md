## Kinesthetic Learning Features
The content is specifically designed for kinesthetic learners with emphasis on:

ü§≤ **Hands-on Activities**: Physical manipulation of objects, drawing, cutting, folding
‚úã **Movement-based Learning**: Body gestures, writing in air, standing/sitting movements  
üéØ **Tactile Experiences**: Using real objects like marbles, plates, paper, scissors
üèÉ **Active Participation**: Engaging multiple senses through physical actions
üìù **Creating with Hands**: Drawing, writing, coloring, cutting, building

## Database Structure
- All content is properly linked to the kinesthetic learning style ID
- Maintains same question/answer structure as auditory version for consistency
- Uses existing course and course_sections infrastructure
- Safe to run multiple times (idempotent script)

## Usage
Kinesthetic learners who access the "Belajar Dasar Pecahan Matematika" course will now see:
- Hands-on, movement-based learning content
- The same comprehensive test questions
- Content optimized for their learning style preferences

## Files Created
1. `create_pecahan_course_kinesthetic_only.sql` - SQL script version
2. `create_kinesthetic_course_content.js` - JavaScript execution script (used successfully)

This completes the kinesthetic dummy data creation using the same mathematical topic (fractions) as the auditory course but with learning content specifically optimized for kinesthetic learning preferences.
