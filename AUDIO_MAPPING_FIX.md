# Audio Mapping Fix Summary

## Problem Fixed
The test page was using hardcoded audio files based on UI question position (Q1.mp3, Q2.mp3, etc.) instead of using the proper database-driven audio mapping. This caused audio files to not match the actual questions being displayed.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created New API Endpoint
- **File**: `/src/app/api/get-question-audio-by-id/route.ts`
- **Purpose**: Retrieves audio data for a specific question ID from the database
- **Returns**: Audio URL, title, duration, and other metadata for the question

### 2. Updated Question Interface
- **File**: `/src/common/courses.ts`
- **Change**: Added `dbId?: string` to Question interface
- **Purpose**: Store the actual database question ID alongside the UI question number

### 3. Modified Test Page Audio Logic
- **File**: `/src/app/courses/[courseId]/test/page.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Updated `getQuestionAudio` function to use database question ID instead of UI position
  - Modified useEffect to fetch audio based on `currentQuestionData.dbId`
  - Made audio fetching async to handle API calls properly

## How It Works Now

1. **Question Display**: Questions are loaded from database with both UI ID (for navigation) and database ID (for audio mapping)
2. **Audio Retrieval**: When a question is displayed, the system uses the database ID to fetch the correct audio file
3. **Proper Mapping**: Each question gets its specific audio file regardless of its position in the UI

## Verification Results

✅ **API Working**: `/api/get-question-audio-by-id` returns correct audio mappings
✅ **Database Mapping**: Questions properly map to their designated audio files
✅ **Local Files**: Audio files are served from `/public/audio-files/`
✅ **Error Handling**: System gracefully handles questions without audio
✅ **Test Integration**: Auditory learners now get the correct audio for each question

## Example Mappings Verified

- Question "Rina punya 23 buku..." → `Q8.mp3`
- Question "Kevin memiliki kue bolu..." → `Q11.mp3`  
- Question "Ibu membeli 3/4 kg gula..." → `Q1.mp3`

## Impact

- ✅ **Fixed**: Auditory learners now hear audio that matches the question text
- ✅ **Scalable**: New questions can be added with proper audio mapping
- ✅ **Maintainable**: Audio mapping is managed through the database
- ✅ **Robust**: System handles missing audio files gracefully
